This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to clone a GitHub repository and synchronize the files and changes with your local directory. Following these steps will allow you to have an up-to-date copy of the repository on your machine.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

Git installed on your local machine. If Git is not installed, you can download and install it from the official website: Git Downloads.
A GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can create an account for free at GitHub.

## Cloning the Repository
To clone the GitHub repository and get a local copy of the files, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository. You can use the cd command to change directories. For example, to navigate to the Documents folder, you can use cd Documents.

3. Once you are in the desired directory, go to the GitHub repository page in your web browser.

4. Click on the Code button, and then click on the Copy icon to copy the repository URL.

5. Return to your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   git clone <repository_url>   
   Replace <repository_url> with the URL you copied in the previous step. Press Enter to execute the command.

Git will download all the files from the repository and create a new directory with the repository's name in your current directory. The cloning process might take some time, depending on the repository's size and your internet connection.
